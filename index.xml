Replicated here for posterity.
Generally, my process for a pwn challenge is:
1. Recon Figure out what kind of program you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with &amp;ndash; run file to see what kind of binary it is, maybe checksec to see what kind of security measures it has, figure out how to get it to run on your system Run the program a few times as a user, just so you can be familiar with what it does.</description></item><item><title>Meeting 11/08/23</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/meeting-11-08-23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:10:33 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/meeting-11-08-23/</guid><description>Ni Haowdy members!
Last night, we had our first lockpicking meeting of the school year! Zane led us through an introduction to lockpicking and the various locks we have. Lockpicking is a great outlet for puzzle-solving as well as a practical tool if you are ever locked out of our apartment :)

The competition tasked us with breaking into the infrastructure of a fake ransomware group. Aside from an engaging and topical theme, it gave us a chance to put our offensive skills to the test as we exploited Windows machines, achieved remote code execution via PHP, pivoted around their environment, and lost our sanity to DNS.
Our teams were able to bring home 2nd and 4th place out of 18 teams total, with several other universities competing.</description></item><item><title>Armis Workshop</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/armis-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 09:54:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/armis-workshop/</guid><description>Last Friday night, we were very fortunate to host Terry Boedeker of Armis to discuss IoT security in preparation for Cyberforce next weekend!

author: notforsale
Solution First off, we navigate to the offshift-dev github account, linked from the offshift site. Unfortunately, nothing there. Searching google for “offshift github” brings us to a different github with a single suspicious repository. This has two commits, one where files are uploaded, and one in which the _pycache_ folder is deleted. That folder sounds interesting, so we clone the repository, and checkout the commit where the files were added:</description></item><item><title>Crowdstrike Adversary Quest - Much Sad</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/crowdstrike-adversary-quest-much-sad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/crowdstrike-adversary-quest-much-sad/</guid><description>Prompt We have received some information that CATAPULT SPIDER has encrypted a client’s cat pictures and successfully extorted them for a ransom of 1337 Dogecoin.

During one of the commercial breaks of my favorite state sponsored educational video, there was some interference once again. There was a woman wearing some sort of face mask and there were strange tones. The tones were familiar and rang a bell, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on them. I don’t know what these things mean, but maybe you can figure it out.</description></item><item><title>BSidesPDX - Please Stand By</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/bsidespdx-please-stand-by/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/bsidespdx-please-stand-by/</guid><description>Prompt Category: Over The Air

I was watching my regularly scheduled state sponsored programming when I got some strange interference. It sounded like a little girl was talking to me but I couldn’t understand what she was saying. Can you figure it out? There’s no space for mistakes, and no room for questions.

Prompt Exact prompt has been forgotten. Linked to this GitHub repo
Solution As I mentioned in the writeup for leak, I was in a very githubby mindset when I started this challenge. For that reason, I solved this challenge first.
A quick inspection of the repo shows that it features an accidentally committed SSH private key and matching public key. I copied the text of these out of the commit log, and into chall and chall.</description></item><item><title>EkoPartyCTF - Env</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/ekopartyctf-env/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/ekopartyctf-env/</guid><description>EkoParty CTF 2020 Git 3
Prompt Not too sure of the original prompt, however I did not need it.
Solution After the second part of the git challenge saga, we have gotten a new repository with some new github actions. We know, before analyzing these however, that:
Issues filed to the ekolabs repo will be ‘moved’ to the ekoparty-internal repo. We control content in the submitted issues, and this is copied to the new issues in ekoparty-internal repo.</description></item><item><title>EkoPartyCTF - Leak</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/ekopartyctf-leak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/ekopartyctf-leak/</guid><description>EkoParty CTF 2020 Git 1
Prompt Exact prompt has been forgotten. Linked to this GitHub repo
Solution This solution was quite obscure, as I approached this challenge in a github mindset, not a ctf::misc one. In light of this, I solved the second challenge first 😛
When I got on to solving this one, it took me several runs through the full commit history of the repo before seeing this:</description></item><item><title>Fword CTF - Identity Fraud</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/fword-ctf-identity-fraud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/fword-ctf-identity-fraud/</guid><description>Points: 419 Solves: 86 Category: OSINT

Prompt This time we have a username. Can you track down NahamConTron?
Solution I used the namechk tools from the OSINT Framework Site. Specifically, I used OSINT Framework &amp;gt; Username &amp;gt; Username Search Engines &amp;gt; Namechk, similarly to in AUCTF.
namechk tells me that there are claimed usernames for the name NahamConTron for many sites, including Instagram.
Checking out the Instagram account, we get the flag.

Download the file below.

Solution Opening the file does not do much, but it would not be that easy.
Using file we can find out that this is an OOXML document:
$ file microsooft.docx microsooft.docx: Microsoft OOXML Based on this, and some quick reading, we can see that this format can contain files.

Solution I used the namechk tools from the OSINT Framework Site. Specifically, I used OSINT Framework &amp;gt; Username &amp;gt; Username Search Engines &amp;gt; Namechk, similarly to in AUCTF.
namechk tells me that there are claimed usernames for the name NahamConTron for many sites:

Solution This provided archive contains 90,000 JPEG’s. I extracted all of them to ./images (relative to this README’s PWD). Each of these images has a size of 1 pixel.

Prompt See what you can find.
AUCTFShh
Author: c
Solution AUCTFShh looks like a username. To find where that username is in use, we can either check manually (as I started out doing), or use some tools from the OSINT Framework Site. Specifically, I used OSINT Framework &amp;gt; Username &amp;gt; Username Search Engines &amp;gt; Namechk.

Task 6 has us exploit a loophole in the smart-contracts to recover the decryption key without spending any ether (not including transaction costs). We are given the source for three smart contracts: the Escrow contract, the Ransom contract, and the Registry contract.

Task 7 has us refund the victims who have already paid the ransom. In other words, we need to recover all the funds in the Escrow contract, then transfer the funds to the victims. Recall that from task 6, we found that we could deploy and authenticate arbitrary ransom contracts.
Scanning for Vulnerabilities A natural place we can start looking for a vulnerability is the requestRefund() function.</description></item><item><title>Meeting 1/10</title><link>https://osusec.org/blog/meeting-1-10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://osusec.org/blog/meeting-1-10/</guid><description>Thanks for a great first meeting for Winter 2019!
